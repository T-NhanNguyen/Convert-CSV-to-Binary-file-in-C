# Convert-CSV-to-Binary-file-in-C
Compile with: gcc -Wall -o main main.c csv_bin.c -lpthread

This is a WIP CHEATSHEET, but this is a simple data structure approach with multi threading to convert a linked list of any size into a binary file.
The purpose of this is so you can conviniently implement this into your working code or use it with modification to the current file names within main.c to convert your csv.
